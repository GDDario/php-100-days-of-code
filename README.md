### README

As specified in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), I will follow the guide to improve my knowledge and practices in PHP.

Scripts that do not include HTML can be executed using only the php file.php command, but when there are HTML files, you need to use the built-in PHP server, or in cases that involve a MySQL connection, use XAMPP.
