### README

As specified in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), I will follow the guide to improve my knowledge and practices in PHP.

At every lesson/project, I will also create notes containing some insights.

### How to run
The scripts that do not include HTML can be executed using only the php file.php command, but when there are HTML files, you need to use the built-in PHP server, running the command php -S localhost:8080 in the desired directory, and accessing the file through the URL, as in the example "localhost:8080/script.php".
