In PHP, there are fundamentally 3 array types:

1. Indexed arrays: Indexed arrays are arrays where the elements are stored and accessed using numeric indexes.
2. Associative arrays: The elements are accessed by string keys.
3. Multidimensional arrays: The elements contain one or more arrays as elements.

PHP arrays are easily converted to JSON using the `json_encode` and `json_decode` functions.
