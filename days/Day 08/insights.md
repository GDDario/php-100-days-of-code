In PHP, there are fundamentally 3 array types:

1. Indexed arrays: The indexed arrays are arrays where the elements are storaged and accessed using numeric indexes.
2. Associative arrays: The elements are accessed by string keys.
3. Multidimensional arrays: The elements contains one or more arrays as elements.

The Php arrays are easily converted to json using the json_encode and json_decode functions.
